# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in React

This project demonstrates Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), a fundamental security concept, using React.  RBAC ensures users only access system parts relevant to their roles.

## Implementation Details

The application features:

* **User Authentication:**  A login screen verifies user credentials against a hardcoded list (for simplicity; a secure backend would be used in production).
* **Role Assignment:** Users are assigned roles: "admin," "manager," "support," or "member."
* **Conditional Rendering:**  The core of RBAC.  Content dynamically changes based on the user's role:
    * **Admin:**  Accesses a "User Management" section (simulated creation, modification, deletion of users).
    * **Manager:**  Accesses an "Analytics" section (currently a placeholder).
    * **Support:** Accesses a "Tickets" section (currently a placeholder).
    * **Member:**  Sees only the login screen.
* **UI Framework:** React for component-based development and Tailwind CSS for styling.
* **Placeholder Components:**  "Analytics" and "Tickets" sections use placeholders indicating where full functionality would be added.  These display an "Under Construction" message.

## Project Summary

This project isn't a fully functional dashboard but a focused demonstration of RBAC implementation in React. It provides a simplified, easily understood example of this crucial security principle.  Using hardcoded data and placeholders keeps the project concise and ideal for educational purposes or showcasing this specific functionality.
